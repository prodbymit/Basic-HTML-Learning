<button></button> makes a button that you can click.

<main></main>, <section></section>, and <footer></footer> are just formatting code, regulatory in all websites.

<a href=""> putting a link in the "" will direct the user to that link.

<ul></ul> unordered list, followed with <li></li> inside of the ul.

<form></form> is a container for input elements.
<textarea rows="x"></textarea> putting any number where "x" is creates a text area with that many rows. Ensure that the arrows are closed together ><.
